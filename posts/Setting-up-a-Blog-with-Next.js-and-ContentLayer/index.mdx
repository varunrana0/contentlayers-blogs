# Quickstart Guide: Setting Up a Blog with Next.js and ContentLayer

Want to set up a new blog? With **Next.js** and **ContentLayer**, it's a breeze. Follow this step-by-step guide to get started!

## Before You Jump In:

-   Ensure **Node.js** and **npm/yarn** are installed on your system.
-   Familiarity with **React** and **Next.js** is helpful but not mandatory.

## Kickstart a New Next.js App

Start by setting up a Next.js project:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest --typescript --tailwind --experimental-app --eslint contentlayer-example
cd contentlayer-example
```

### Step 2: Get ContentLayer Ready

Now, we'll add some (dependencies) for ContentLayer:

```bash
npm install contentlayer next-contentlayer date-fns
```

### Step 4: Setting Up `tsconfig.json`

Tweak your `tsconfig.json` or `jsconfig.json` for seamless integration:

```typescript
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "paths": {
      "contentlayer/generated": ["./.contentlayer/generated"]
    }
  },
  "include": [
    "next-env.d.ts",
    "**/*.ts",
    "**/*.tsx",
    ".next/types/**/*.ts",
    ".contentlayer/generated"
  ]
}
```

### Step 5: Structure Your Blog with ContentLayer

Craft a structure for your blog posts using `contentlayer.config.ts` in your project root:

```typescript
import { defineDocumentType, makeSource } from "contentlayer/source-files";

export const Post = defineDocumentType(() => ({
	name: "Post",
	// This is the file path where your post.md or post.mdx file exist outside of src/app.
	filePathPattern: `**/**/*.mdx`, // In my case it is `posts/post-01.mdx`
	fields: {
		title: { type: "string", required: true },
		date: { type: "date", required: true },
	},
	computedFields: {
		url: {
			type: "string",
			resolve: (post) => `/posts/${post._raw.flattenedPath}`,
		},
	},
}));

export default makeSource({ contentDirPath: "posts", documentTypes: [Post] });
```

you can also set the content type of your post in `contentlayer.config.ts`

```typescript
contentType: "mdx",
```

### Step 6: Time to Blog!

Head over to the posts folder and begin with a file, say `post-01.mdx`:

```typescript
---
title: first post
date: 2023-10-14
description: this is my first blog post.
---

// rest of you mdx content here
```

### Conclusion

That's it! With these steps, you're equipped to share your knowledge and stories with the world. Remember, regularly updating your blog with quality content is key for SEO. So, keep writing and happy blogging!
