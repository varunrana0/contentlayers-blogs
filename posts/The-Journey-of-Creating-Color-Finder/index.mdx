# The Birth and Evolution of ColorFinder

There's always a story behind every innovation, and today, I'd like to take you on the journey of how **ColorFinder** came into existence..

## The Spark of an Idea

Like every great idea, ColorFinder started as a simple question: How many times have we stumbled upon a website and wondered about the colors it uses? As a developer and design enthusiast, this question nagged at me more often than I'd like to admit.
